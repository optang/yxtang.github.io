# Working Paper

* [A Mallows-type Model for Preference Learning from (Ranked) Choices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4539900), with Yifan Feng. Under revision at **Management Science**

  * We develop a novel distance-based ranking model that can aggregate into a simple closed-form expression of ranked choice probability.
